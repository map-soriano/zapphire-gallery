## üé® About

**Zapphire Gallery** is a side project I gifted to a friend to showcase his artwork to potential clients as he was trying to gather funds for the upcoming holidays.

He plans to have it serve as his official portfolio of artworks, architectural renders, and projects in the future. Go check out his gallery and you might find something you like!

The contact button on the upper-right corner of the page will redirect you to his Facebook profile where you can message him for art and render commissions.
